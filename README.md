# Deployed On AWS Amplify

# Known Issues
- Developed on 2560 x 1440 screen, needs to be refactored to work with smaller devices. Looking into further fixes with grids (property xs and sm of material ui)
- Should transition to use material ui/react bootstrap, react-mdl is not responsive
- UPDATE JAN 11 - 2021: Haven't deployed backend yet. Expect update tomorrow, pushing backend to heroku. Right now endpoint is pointing toward localhost. (lol)
- UPDATE JAN 19 - 2021: Waiting for Riot Games to approve my API key request, still haven't pushed backend yet
